## üö®Breaking Changes for select chains (SQLDatabase) on 7/28

In an effort to make `langchain` leaner and safer, we are moving select chains to `langchain_experimental`.
This migration has already started, but we are remaining backwards compatible until 7/28.
On that date, we will remove functionality from `langchain`.
Read more about the motivation and the progress [here](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/discussions/8043).
Read how to migrate your code [here](MIGRATE.md).

## Quick Install

```bash
pip install langchain
# or
pip install langsmith && conda install langchain -c conda-forge
```
## Introduction

LangChain is a powerful library that enables developers to build applications using Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository serves as the core of LangChain and provides the tools and utilities to create composable LLM-based applications.

## Use Cases
LangChain can be used to build various applications. Here are some common examples:

## ‚ùì Question Answering over specific documents

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)
- End-to-end Example: [Question Answering over Notion Database](https://github.com/hwchase17/notion-qa)

## üí¨ Chatbots

- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/chatbots/)
- End-to-end Example: [Chat-LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain)

## ü§ñ Agents
- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/)
- End-to-end Example: [GPT+WolframAlpha](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JavaFXpert/Chat-GPT-LangChain)

## üìñ Documentation

Please refer to the [full documentation](https://python.langchain.com) for comprehensive details on using LangChain:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
- API Reference: Detailed documentation of LangChain's API.
- Core Concepts: High-level explanation of key concepts.

## üöÄ What can this help with?

LangChain is designed to help with six main areas, each increasing in complexity:

**üìÉ LLMs and Prompts:**

Manage prompts, optimize prompts, provide a generic interface for all LLMs, and offer common utilities for working with LLMs.

**üîó Chains:**

Go beyond a single LLM call and involve sequences of calls, whether to an LLM or a different utility. LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, integrates with other tools, and offers end-to-end chains for common applications.

**üìö Data Augmented Generation:**

Fetch data from external sources and use it in the generation step. Examples include summarization of long texts and question/answering over specific data sources.

**ü§ñ Agents:**

Let LLMs make decisions, take actions, observe results, and repeat until a task is complete. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents, and examples of end-to-end agents.

**üß† Memory:**

Persist state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, various memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.

**üßê Evaluation:**

[BETA] Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics.Evaluate generative models using language models themselves. LangChain provides prompts/chains to assist in this novel evaluation approach.

For more information on these concepts, please see our [full documentation](https://python.langchain.com).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and Customization
LangChain can be configured to suit your specific needs and use cases. Explore the documentation to understand how to customize LangChain's behavior.
