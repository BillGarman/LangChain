⚡ Building applications with generative models through composability ⚡

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to
combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.
It aims to create:
1. a comprehensive collection of pieces you would ever want to combine
2. a flexible interface for combining pieces into a single comprehensive "chain"
3. a schema for easily saving and sharing those chains

## What can I do with this

This project was largely inspired by a few projects seen on Twitter for which we thought it would make
