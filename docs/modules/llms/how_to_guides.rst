How-To Guides
=============

The examples here all address certain "how-to" guides for working with LLMs.
They are split into two categories:


1. `Generic Functionality <./generic_how_to.rst>`_: Covering generic functionality all LLMs should have.
2. `Integrations <./integrations.rst>`_: Covering integrations with various LLM providers.
3. `Asynchronous <./async_llm.ipynb>`_: Covering asynchronous functionality.
4. `Streaming <./streaming_llm.ipynb>`_: Covering streaming functionality.
