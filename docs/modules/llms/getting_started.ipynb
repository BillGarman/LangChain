    "The LLM class is a class designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) - this class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them. In this part of the documentation, we will focus on generic LLM functionality. For details on working with a specific LLM wrapper, please see the examples in the [How-To section](how_to_guides.rst).\n",
