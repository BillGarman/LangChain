Chains
==========================

Using an LLM in isolation is fine for some simple applications,
but many more complex ones require chaining LLMs - either with eachother or with other experts.
LangChain provides a standard interface for Chains, as well as some common implementations of chains for easy use.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- `How-To Guides <chains/how_to_guides>`_: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to use various types of chains.

- `Reference </reference/chains>`_: API reference documentation for all Chain classes.

- `Conceptual Guide <chains/conceptual_guide>`_: A conceptual guide going over the various concepts related to chains.
