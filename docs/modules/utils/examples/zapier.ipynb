    "\n",
    "**Zapier Natural Language Actions** gives you access to the 5k+ apps, 20k+ actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLA supports apps like Gmail, Salesforce, Trello, Slack, Asana, HubSpot, Google Sheets, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more apps: https://zapier.com/apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Zapier NLA handles ALL the underlying API auth and translation from natural language --> underlying API call --> return simplified output for LLMs. The key idea is you, or your users, expose a set of actions via an oauth-like setup window, which you can then query and execute via a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLA offers both API Key and OAuth for signing NLA API requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Server-side (API Key): for quickly getting started, testing, and production scenarios where LangChain will only use actions exposed in the developer's Zapier account (and will use the developer's connected accounts on Zapier.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. User-facing (Oauth): for production scenarios where you are deploying an end-user facing application and LangChain needs access to end-user's exposed actions and connected accounts on Zapier.com\n",
    "\n",
    "This quick start will focus on the server-side use case for brevity. Review [full docs](https://nla.zapier.com/api/v1/dynamic/docs) or reach out to nla@zapier.com for user-facing oauth developer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example goes over how to use the Zapier integration with a `SimpleSequentialChain`, then an `Agent`.\n",
