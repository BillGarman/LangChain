Callbacks
=========

.. note::
   `Conceptual Guide <./callbacks.html>`_

LangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. 
This is useful for logging, `tracing <../additional_resources/tracing.html>`_, `streaming <./models/llms/examples/streaming_llm.html>`_, and other tasks.

The following sections of documentation are provided:

- `Getting Started <./callbacks/getting_started.html>`_: A getting started guide for callbacks, to get you up and running quickly.

- `How-To Guides <./callbacks/how_to_guides.html>`_: A collection of how-to guides. These highlight how to use various types of callbacks.

- `Reference <../reference/modules/callbacks.html>`_: API reference documentation for all Callback classes.
