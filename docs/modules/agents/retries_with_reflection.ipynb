    "# Retries with Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes Agents will not succeed in their task. This might be e.g. if their reasoning was wrong (i.e., they made the wrong plan) or inefficient (i.e., they are taking too long to get to an answer). In this case, we can use the re-try method Reflection (from https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366).\n",
    "\n",
    "With Reflection, the Agent will think about why their plan failed and what it can do better next time. This reflection, along with the previous trial(s) will be available to the Agent in the next trial. This enables the Agent to solve harder problems.\n",
