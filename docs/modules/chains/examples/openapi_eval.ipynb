       "[\" The first query is just the keyword 'iPhone' - this will likely return a list of iPhone models. The predicted query adds additional parameters to this query, but they are not necessary to answer the original question. The size parameter is irrelevant since the original question is not asking for a specific number of results. The min_price and max_price parameters are also irrelevant since the original question is not asking for a specific price range. All of these additional parameters are likely to limit the results, so the predicted query is not semantically the same as the original. Final Grade: D\",\n",
       " ' The original query specifies that the maximum price for the laptop should be $300. The predicted query, on the other hand, sets the minimum price to $0 and the maximum price to $500. This means that the original query is more specific than the predicted query, as it excludes any laptops that cost more than $300. Therefore, the predicted query is likely to produce more results than the original query, as it is not as restrictive. For this reason, I would give the predicted query a Grade B, as it closely matches the original query, but is not as specific. Final Grade: B',\n",
       " ' The query asks for the cheapest gaming PC, so the predicted query is looking for a gaming PC with size 1, with a minimum price of 0. The max_price is set to null, which means that no maximum price is set, so it will look for the cheapest gaming PC regardless of price. Therefore, the predicted query is semantically the same as the original query and is likely to produce the same answer. Final Grade: A',\n",
       " ' The original query is looking for \"headphone\", while the predicted query is looking for \"tablet\". This is a good start, as it focuses on the right item. The predicted query includes size, min_price, and max_price parameters, which are all relevant to the question. The size parameter is not necessary, as it will not affect the results, but it does no harm either. The min_price and max_price parameters are relevant, as they set the budget for the question. Overall, this predicted query is a strong attempt to answer the question and should produce the desired results. Final Grade: A',\n",
       " ' The original query is looking for laptops with a maximum price of 400. The predicted query is looking for headphones with a size of 5. \\n\\nThis query is not likely to produce the same answer as the original query, because the original query was looking for laptops, not headphones.

       " ' The question we are trying to answer is \"What are the top rated laptops?\". The query we have is \"{\"q\": \"shoe\"}\", which searches for the keyword \\'shoe\\'. This query does not even address the question and therefore is not likely to produce an answer. The predicted query \"{\"q\": \"laptops\", \"size\": 10}\" is a much better fit, as it searches for the keyword \\'laptops\\' and limits the results to the top 10. Therefore, this predicted query is more likely to produce an answer to the question. Final Grade: B',\n",
       " ' The original query was for \"shoes\". The predicted query includes this, so that\\'s a good start. However, the query also includes min_price and max_price, which are not relevant to the question. Additionally, the query includes size which is too specific for the question. For these reasons, I would give the Predicted Query a grade of D. Final Grade: D',\n",
       " ' The original query is asking for a \"professional desktop PC\". The predicted query is asking for a \"skirt\" and specifying a size and price range. While the price range is similar, the type of item is completely different. Therefore, the predicted query will likely not produce the same answer. Final Grade: F',\n",
       " ' The original query only had a \"max_price\" parameter, which means that the user does not care about the cost and is willing to pay for the highest quality Desktop PC available. The predicted query, however, also has a \"min_price\" parameter, which implies that the user is looking for a professional Desktop PC which is also within a certain price range. This would result in different results from the original query, and therefore the predicted query does not semantically match the original query. Final Grade: F']"

       "[\" The first query is just the keyword 'iPhone' - this will likely return a list of iPhone models. The predicted query adds additional parameters to this query, but they are not necessary to answer the original question. The size parameter is irrelevant since the original question is not asking for a specific number of results. The min_price and max_price parameters are also irrelevant since the original question is not asking for a specific price range. All of these additional parameters are likely to limit the results, so the predicted query is not semantically the same as the original. Final Grade: D\",\n",
       " ' The original query specifies that the maximum price for the laptop should be $300. The predicted query, on the other hand, sets the minimum price to $0 and the maximum price to $500. This means that the original query is more specific than the predicted query, as it excludes any laptops that cost more than $300. Therefore, the predicted query is likely to produce more results than the original query, as it is not as restrictive. For this reason, I would give the predicted query a Grade B, as it closely matches the original query, but is not as specific. Final Grade: B',\n",
       " ' The query asks for the cheapest gaming PC, so the predicted query is looking for a gaming PC with size 1, with a minimum price of 0. The max_price is set to null, which means that no maximum price is set, so it will look for the cheapest gaming PC regardless of price. Therefore, the predicted query is semantically the same as the original query and is likely to produce the same answer. Final Grade: A',\n",
       " ' The original query is looking for \"headphone\", while the predicted query is looking for \"tablet\". This is a good start, as it focuses on the right item. The predicted query includes size, min_price, and max_price parameters, which are all relevant to the question. The size parameter is not necessary, as it will not affect the results, but it does no harm either. The min_price and max_price parameters are relevant, as they set the budget for the question. Overall, this predicted query is a strong attempt to answer the question and should produce the desired results. Final Grade: A',\n",
       " ' The original query is looking for laptops with a maximum price of 400. The predicted query is looking for headphones with a size of 5. \\n\\nThis query is not likely to produce the same answer as the original query, because the original query was looking for laptops, not headphones. Furthermore, it is unclear what size of headphones the predicted query is looking for, which could lead to inaccurate results.\\n\\nFinal Grade: F',\n",
       " ' The question we are trying to answer is \"What are the top rated laptops?\". The query we have is \"{\"q\": \"shoe\"}\", which searches for the keyword \\'shoe\\'. This query does not even address the question and therefore is not likely to produce an answer. The predicted query \"{\"q\": \"laptops\", \"size\": 10}\" is a much better fit, as it searches for the keyword \\'laptops\\' and limits the results to the top 10. Therefore, this predicted query is more likely to produce an answer to the question. Final Grade: B',\n",
       " ' The original query was for \"shoes\". The predicted query includes this, so that\\'s a good start. However, the query also includes min_price and max_price, which are not relevant to the question. Additionally, the query includes size which is too specific for the question. For these reasons, I would give the Predicted Query a grade of D. Final Grade: D',\n",
       " ' The original query is asking for a \"professional desktop PC\". The predicted query is asking for a \"skirt\" and specifying a size and price range. While the price range is similar, the type of item is completely different. Therefore, the predicted query will likely not produce the same answer. Final Grade: F',\n",
       " ' The original query only had a \"max_price\" parameter, which means that the user does not care about the cost and is willing to pay for the highest quality Desktop PC available. The predicted query, however, also has a \"min_price\" parameter, which implies that the user is looking for a professional Desktop PC which is also within a certain price range. This would result in different results from the original query, and therefore the predicted query does not semantically match the original query. Final Grade: F',\n",
