    "# Router Chains: Selecting from multiple prompts with MultiPromptChain\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `RouterChain` paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects the prompt to use for a given input. Specifically we show how to use the `MultiPromptChain` to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt."
