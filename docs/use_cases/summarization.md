# Summarization

Summarization involves creating a smaller summary of multiple longer documents.
This can be useful for distilling long documents into the core pieces of information

The following resources exist:
- [Summarization Notebook](/modules/chains/combine_docs_examples/summarize.ipynb): A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.
- [CombineDocuments Chains](/modules/chains/combine_docs.md): Specific types of chains by which you can accomplish this task.
- [Data Augmented Generation](combine_docs.md): An overview of data augmented generation, which is the general concept of combining external data with LLMs (of which this is a subset).
