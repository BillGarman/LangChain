    "# Agent Simulations V3\n",
    "\n",
    "What is new in this notebook:\n",
    "- A generic `RoundRobinSimulator` for running a simulation of an agent dialogue in a round-robin fashion. It takes an `agents` list and a `leader_idx` as input. The agents speak in a round-robin fashion, where the agent at index `i` speaks to the agent at index `(i+1) % len(agents)`. The agent at index `leader_idx` speaks first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments:\n",
    "- This uses the `ChatOpenAI` model, which expects chat roles to either be `assistant` or `user`. This restricts us to only two agents. Therefore, even though `RoundRobinSimulator` can support multiple agents, it really only makes sense to use it for two agents because the AIMessage that agent `i` sends is received as a HumanMessage by agent `i+1`.\n",
    "- If all we want is a simulator for two agents right now, the `RoundRobinSimulator` is a complete MVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [CAMEL](https://www.camel-ai.org/) as a use case."
