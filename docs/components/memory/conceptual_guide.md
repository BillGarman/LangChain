## Memory
By default, Chains and Agents are stateless, meaning that they treat each incoming query independently.
In some applications (chatbots being a GREAT example) it is highly important to remember previous interactions,
both at a short term but also at a long term level. The concept of "Memory" exists to do exactly that.
