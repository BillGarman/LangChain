    "# Translate Documents\n",
    "Comparing documents through embeddings has the benefit of working across multiple languages. \"Harrison says hello\" and \"Harrison dice hola\" will occupy similar positions in the vector space because they have the same meaning semantically.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it can still be useful to use a LLM translate documents into other languages before vectorizing them. This is especially helpful when users are expected to query the knowledge base in different languages, or when state of the art embeddings models are not available for a given language.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish this using the [Doctran](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran) library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to translate documents between languages."
