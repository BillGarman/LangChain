    "## Description and motivation\n",
    "Similar in concept to the <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/markdown_header_metadata\">`MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`</a>, the `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline.\n",

    "There can be quite a bit of structural variation from one HTML document to another, and while `HTMLHeaderTextSplitter` will attempt to attach all \"relevant\" headers to any given chunk, it can sometimes miss certain headers. For example, the algorithm assumes an informational hierarchy in which headers are always at nodes \"above\" associated text, i.e. prior siblings, ancestors, and combinations thereof. In the following news article (as of the writing of this document), the document is structured such that the text of the top-level headline, while tagged \"h1\", is in a *distinct* subtree from the text elements that we'd expect it to be *\"above\"*&mdash;so we can observe that the \"h1\" element and its associated text do not show up in the chunk metadata (but, where applicable, we do see \"h2\" and its associated text):   \n"

The El NiÃ±o phase occurs when these ocean temperatures are warmer than normal for an extended period.  \\nThis yearâ\\x80\\x99s El NiÃ±o began in June, is expected to be strong this winter and last at least into early next spring, according to NOAAâ\\x80\\x99s Climate Prediction Center.  \\nEl NiÃ±oâ\\x80\\x99s cooler counterpart, La NiÃ±a, played a huge role in the past three winters across the US, keeping the South dry while parts of the West received a lot of much-needed snow.  \\nEarly winter predictions from the Climate Prediction Center have many of the hallmarks of typical El NiÃ±o winters, auguring changes to come.\", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='No two El NiÃ±o winters are the same, but many have temperature and precipitation trends in common.  \\nAverage conditions during an El NiÃ±o winter across the continental US.  \\nOne of the major reasons is the position of the jet stream, which often shifts south during an El NiÃ±o winter. This shift typically brings wetter and cooler weather to the South while the North becomes drier and warmer, according to NOAA.  \\nBecause the jet stream is essentially a river of air that storms flow through, they can move across the South with increased frequency during an El NiÃ±o winter. More storms means more precipitation, typically from the southern Plains to the Southeast. This could be crucial for states like Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi plagued by drought.  \\nA wetter southern tier and a drier northern tier in an outlook for this winter from the Climate Prediction Center have all the fingerprints of an El NiÃ±o winter.  \\nThe combination of cooler weather and more frequent precipitation may also increase the chances for wintry precipitation like freezing rain, sleet and snow to fall in the South.  \\nEl NiÃ±o typically leads to a milder winter in the North, from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies, Plains and Midwest. Individual storms can still form and deliver bouts of brutal cold or heavy snow to these regions, but they are typically less frequent.  \\nThis would be bad news for portions of the Midwest also dealing with extreme and exceptional levels of drought, and for snowpack in the Pacific Northwest â\\x80\\x93 a key water source for the region.  \\nNote the highest chances for above normal temperatures in an outlook for this winter from the Climate Prediction Center are in the northern tier of the US, which generally mirrors climatology.  \\nEl NiÃ±o winter patterns are less regular in California, the Southwest and the Northeast.  \\nThe frequency of storms and uptick in precipitation across California and portions of the Southwest may depend on the overall strength of the El NiÃ±o. A stronger El NiÃ±o may lead to more storms, low elevation rain and high elevation snow, while a weaker version could hang the Southwest out to dry.  \\nThe Northeast doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have a well-defined set of expectations during an El NiÃ±o winter. The region can be milder overall like its other northern counterparts, but it can also be at the mercy of robust coastal storms moving along the Atlantic Coast.  \\nLooking back at recent El NiÃ±o winters can also help visualize what the upcoming winter may have in store:  \\nA weak El NiÃ±o during the 2018-2019 season had several notable storms, including one in December that brought snow and ice from Texas to the Carolinas. The season was also the wettest winter on record for the US mainland and featured above-average temperatures across much of the East, according to NOAA.  \\nA very strong El NiÃ±o during the 2015-2016 winter contributed to the warmest winter on record for the US mainland, according to NOAA. The warm winter didnâ\\x80\\x99t prevent massive snowstorms, including a deadly blizzard that brought East Coast travel to a standstill.  \\nThe 2009-2010 winter was the last with an El NiÃ±o of the same forecast strength as this year. It was quite cold across the southern and central US and very wet and snowy along the East Coast, according to data from NOAA. The season was notorious for multiple blizzards slamming the Northeast in rapid succession.', metadata={'Header 2': 'What could this winter look like?'}),\n",
