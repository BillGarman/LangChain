    "SQL Chains and Agents can be used to **build and run** SQL queries based on natural language prompts. \n",

    "Some use cases may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions\n",
    "- Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data\n",
    "- Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze\n",
