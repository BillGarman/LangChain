    "The pipeline for building a solution for QA over a code base is:\n",

    "1. `Load the code base:` Load code base into documents.\n",
    "2. `Split the code base:` Split documents.\n",
    "3. `Store the code base`:  Code snippets are embedded using a code-aware embedding model and stored in a vector database.\n",
    "4. `Construct the Retriever:` Conversational RetrieverChain searches the VectorStore to identify the most relevant code snippets for a given query.\n",
    "5. `Ask questions about the code:` Define a list of questions to ask about the codebase, and then use the `ConversationalRetrievalChain` to generate context-aware answers. The LLM (GPT-4) generates comprehensive, context-aware answers based on retrieved code snippets and conversation history.\n",

      "**Answer**: Based on the provided code snippets, it seems that the class hierarchy for the `Chain` class is already well-defined and organized. The `Chain` class serves as the base class for various types of chains, such as `LLMChain`, `MapReduceChain`, `RouterChain`, etc. This hierarchy allows for easy composition and reusability of components.\n",
