# Weights & Biases


> [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides) is the machine learning platform for developers to build 
> better models faster. Use `W&B`'s lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, 
> version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results 
> and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.

**Note**: _the `WandbCallbackHandler` is being deprecated in favour of the `WandbTracer`_ . 
In future please use the `WandbTracer` as it is more flexible and allows for more granular logging. 

See the [Prompt Engineering LLMs with LangChain and W&B](https://wandb.ai/a-sh0ts/langchain_callback_demo/reports/Prompt-Engineering-LLMs-with-LangChain-and-W-B--VmlldzozNjk1NTUw#ðŸ‘‹-how-to-build-a-callback-in-langchain-for-better-prompt-engineering
) example.



## Installation and Setup

We need to get [Azure credentials](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/quickstart.html) and
set up the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable.
Also, see more information about [MLflow Tracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow?view=azureml-api-2).

For the `WandbTracer`, we need to install:
```bash
pip install wandb
```

For **deprecated** `WandbCallbackHandler`, we need to install these packages:
```bash
pip install wandb
pip install pandas
pip install textstat
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```



## Callbacks

```python
from langchain.callbacks import WandbTracer
from langchain.callbacks import WandbCallbackHandler  # deprecated!
```
