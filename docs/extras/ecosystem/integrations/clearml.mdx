## Installation and Setup

In order to properly keep track of your langchain experiments and their results, you can enable the `ClearML` integration. We use the `ClearML Experiment Manager` that neatly tracks and organizes all your experiment runs.

We need to get [API credentials](https://app.clear.ml/settings/workspace-configuration) and
set up the environment variables: `CLEARML_API_ACCESS_KEY` and `CLEARML_API_SECRET_KEY`.


```bash
pip install clearml
```


## Callbacks

```python
from langchain.callbacks import ClearMLCallbackHandler
```

[See an example](/docs/modules/callbacks/integrations/clearml.html).
