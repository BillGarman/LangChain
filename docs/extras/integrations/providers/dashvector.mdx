# DashVector

> [DashVector](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/2510225.html) is a scalable and fully-managed vector-database service for building various machine learning applications.  

This page covers how to use the DashVector ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DashVector wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
Install the Python SDK:
```bash
pip install dashvector
```

## VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around DashVector collections, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import DashVector
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the DashVector wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dashvector.html)
