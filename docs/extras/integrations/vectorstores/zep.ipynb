    "\n",
    "Zep is an open source long-term memory store for LLM applications. Zep makes it easy to add relevant documents,\n",
    "chat history memory & rich user data to your LLM app's prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `ZepVectorStore` works with `Documents` and is intended to be used as a `Retriever`.\n",
    "It offers separate functionality to Zep's `ZepMemory` class, which is designed for persisting, enriching\n",
    "and searching your user's chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Zep's VectorStore? 🤖🚀\n",
    "Zep automatically embeds documents added to the Zep Vector Store using low-latency models local to the Zep server.\n",
    "The Zep client also offers async interfaces for all document operations. These two together with Zep's chat memory\n",
    " functionality make Zep ideal for building conversational LLM apps where latency and performance are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "Follow the [Zep Quickstart Guide](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/quickstart/) to install and get started with Zep.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need your Zep API URL and optionally an API key to use the Zep VectorStore. \n",
    "See the [Zep docs](https://docs.getzep.com) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the examples below, we're using Zep's auto-embedding feature which automatically embed documents on the Zep server \n",
    "using low-latency embedding models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "- If you pass in an `Embeddings` instance Zep will use this to embed documents rather than auto-embed them.\n",
    "You must also set your document collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`. \n",
    "- If you set your collection to `isAutoEmbedded === false`, you must pass in an `Embeddings` instance."
