Making light of them through jokes can perpetuate harmful attitudes towards animals and contribute to a culture of disregard for their well-being. Instead, I suggest focusing on learning about bears and their habitats, and finding ways to help protect and conserve them.'"

Task decomposition can be approached in different ways, including (1) using language models with simple prompts like \"Steps for XYZ,\" (2) utilizing task-specific instructions, and (3) incorporating human inputs.
