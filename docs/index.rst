Welcome to LangChain
==========================

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to
combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

The documentation is organized in the following manner:

First, we a complete getting started example, including installation and covering all major concepts.

Next, we outline the main components of LangChain.

Then, we go through some main use cases for LangChain.

After that, we have a page for all the reference documents.

Finally, we have a gallery consisting of awesome projects built using LangChain!
