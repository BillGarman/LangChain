      "{'statement': [' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young and feed them milk from mammary glands. They do not lay eggs. So, the answer to this question is that no type of mammal lays eggs.', '\\n\\n1. What type of mammal lays eggs?\\n\\nAnswer: Monotremes, which are mammals that lay eggs, are the only mammals that lay eggs.\\n\\n2. What monotreme lays the biggest eggs?\\n\\nAnswer: The largest monotreme egg is laid by the echidna, which can lay eggs up to 10 cm in length.', \"\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the mammals. Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur, feed their young with milk produced by mammary glands, and have a more complex nervous system than other animals. \\n\\nNow, let's consider eggs. Egg-laying mammals, or monotremes, lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The three species of monotremes are the platypus, the echidna, and the two species of spiny anteaters. \\n\\nOf these, the echidna lays the biggest eggs. Echidnas lay eggs that weigh around 10 grams and are about 25 mm long.\", ' Mammals are typically known to give birth to live young, so there is no mammal that lays eggs.  The animals that lay the biggest eggs are birds, with the ostrich laying the largest eggs of any bird.', '\\n\\n1. What type of animals lay eggs?\\nAnswer: Birds and some reptiles, such as turtles and crocodiles, lay eggs.\\n\\n2. Which of these animals are mammals?\\nAnswer: None of these animals are mammals; mammals give birth to live young.', \" Mammals are animals that give birth to live young, so it's not likely that a mammal lays eggs.  Birds, reptiles, and amphibians lay eggs, so the answer to this question would be none.\", '\\n\\nFirst, a mammal is an animal that is warm-blooded and has fur. \\n\\nSecond, the biggest eggs are usually laid by birds. \\n\\nTherefore, the answer is that no type of mammal lays the biggest eggs; the biggest eggs are laid by birds.', ' Mammals lay eggs, so we are looking for a mammal that lays the biggest eggs. That mammal would be the elephant. Elephants lay the largest eggs of any mammal, with a single egg weighing up to 11 pounds.', '\\nMammals lay eggs, so the answer to this question would be a mammal that lays the biggest eggs. The mammal that lays the biggest eggs is the echidna, also known as a spiny anteater.', '\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s consider what is meant by \"mammal.\" Mammals are a class of vertebrate animals that have hair or fur, produce milk for their young, and have a four-chambered heart.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s think about what is meant by \"biggest eggs.\" Biggest in this case likely means the largest in terms of size or volume.\\n\\nGiven this information, the answer to the question is the elephant. Elephants are mammals and they lay large, leathery eggs (also known as \"calves\") that can weigh up to 10 pounds.', ' Mammals lay eggs, so the first step is to identify which mammals lay eggs. Monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs, so the mammal that lays the biggest eggs is the monotreme that lays the biggest eggs. The largest egg of any monotreme is laid by the echidna, which can lay eggs up to 11 cm long and 6 cm wide.', ' Mammals lay eggs, but not all mammals lay eggs. The only mammals that lay eggs are monotremes, which are a group of mammals that includes the platypus and the echidna. Of these two animals, the platypus lays the largest eggs, which can be up to 1.5 inches in length.', ' First, what type of mammal lays eggs? The answer is monotremes, which are mammals that lay eggs.  Of the three monotreme species, the biggest egg-layers are the two species of echidnas - the short-beaked echidna and the long-beaked echidna.  The egg laid by these species is about the size of a grape, making it the largest egg laid by any mammal.', ' Mammals lay eggs, so the answer to this question would be a mammal that lays the biggest eggs. The biggest eggs laid by a mammal are those laid by the Long-Beaked Echidna, which can lay eggs up to four inches long.', ' First, what type of mammal lays eggs? Monotremes.  Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs and include the platypus and the echidna.  Of these two, the echidna lays the largest eggs, measuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter.', \" Mammals lay eggs, so the type of mammal we're looking for is a mammal that lays eggs. The two types of mammals that lay eggs are monotremes and marsupials. Monotremes lay the largest eggs, so the type of mammal that lays the biggest eggs is a monotreme.\", ' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young and feed their young with milk from their mammary glands.  Therefore, the answer to this question is that no mammal lays eggs.  The animals that lay the biggest eggs are reptiles such as the leatherback sea turtle, which lays eggs up to the size of a football.', ' Mammals are animals that give birth to live young, nurse their young with milk, and have hair or fur.  So, any mammal that lays eggs would not be considered a true mammal.  The animal that lays the biggest eggs is the Ostrich, which is a bird, not a mammal.', ' Mammals are warm-blooded animals that have hair and give birth to live young.  The biggest eggs laid by mammals are those of the elephant.  Elephant eggs are tiny, measuring only about 0.08 inches (2 mm) in diameter, but they are the largest eggs laid by any mammal.', '\\n\\n1. The biggest eggs are laid by birds, not mammals. \\n2. The bird that lays the biggest egg relative to its body size is the ostrich. \\n3. Ostriches are flightless birds, and thus, not mammals.', '\\n\\nFirst, what type of mammal lays eggs? That would be a monotreme. Monotremes are a subclass of mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.\\n\\nSecond, which monotreme lays the biggest eggs? That would be the echidna. Echidnas are egg-laying mammals native to Australia and New Guinea. They lay the biggest eggs of any monotreme, with an average size of 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide.', \" Mammals lay eggs, so we're looking for a type of mammal. The biggest mammal eggs are laid by the elephant.\", '\\n\\nFirst, what type of mammal lays eggs? There are only two types of mammals that lay eggs: monotremes and marsupials.\\n\\nSecond, which of these two types of mammals lays the biggest eggs? Monotremes lay the biggest eggs. Specifically, the echidna and the platypus, both of which are monotremes, lay the largest eggs relative to their body size of any mammal.', '\\n\\nFirst, we need to identify which mammals lay eggs. Mammals that lay eggs include monotremes, which are a group of mammals that lay eggs and include the platypus and the echidna.\\n\\nNow that we know which mammals lay eggs, we can look at which one lays the biggest egg. According to research, the platypus lays the biggest egg among all monotremes. The eggs of the platypus are between 1.2 and 2 centimeters long and 0.7 and 1.2 centimeters wide.', \" Mammals are animals that give birth to live young, so they don't lay eggs.  The animals that lay the biggest eggs include birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The largest egg laid by a bird is the ostrich egg, which can weigh up to 1.5 kilograms (3.3 pounds). The largest egg laid by a reptile is the whale shark egg, which is up to 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) in diameter. The largest egg laid by an amphibian is the Goliath frog egg, which can be up to 11 centimeters (4.3 inches) in diameter.\"]}\n",
