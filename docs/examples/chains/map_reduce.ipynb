       "\" President Biden is addressing the American people and their allies, discussing the recent aggression of Russia's Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. He outlines the actions taken by the US and its allies to hold Putin accountable, including economic sanctions, cutting off access to technology, and seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs. He is also providing military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and is mobilizing ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries. He is also passing legislation to provide economic relief to Americans, rebuild America, and make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing. He is also advocating for the passage of the Bipartisan Innovation Act, and is taking steps to ensure that everyone has access to free tests, treatments, and vaccines. He is also calling for Congress to pass measures to reduce gun violence, and is proposing a Unity Agenda for the Nation to beat the opioid epidemic, take on mental health, support veterans, and end cancer as we know it.\""
