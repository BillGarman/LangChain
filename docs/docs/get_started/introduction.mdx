# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:

- **Open-source libraries**: Build your applications using LangChain's [modular building blocks](/docs/expression_language/) and [components](/docs/modules/). Integrate with hundreds of [third-party providers](/docs/integrations/platforms/).
- **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn any chain into a REST API with [LangServe](/docs/langserve).

  }}
  title="LangChain Framework Overview"

Concretely, the **open-source libraries** consist of several packages:

- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.

The main value props of these packages are:

1. **Components**: composable tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.

The broader LangChain ecosystem consists of:

- **[LangSmith](/docs/langsmith)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
- **[LangGraph](/docs/langgraph)**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.
- **[LangServe](/docs/langserve)**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs.

## Get started

We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

[See here](/docs/get_started/installation) for instructions on how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

:::note

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.

## Use cases

If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our [use-cases](/docs/use_cases).
They're walkthroughs and techniques for common end-to-end tasks, such as:

- [Question answering with RAG](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/)
- [Extracting structured output](/docs/use_cases/extraction/)
- [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots/)
- and more!


## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

LCEL is the foundation of many of LangChain's components, and is a declarative way to compose chains. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest ‚Äúprompt + LLM‚Äù chain to the most complex chains.

- **[Get started](/docs/expression_language/)**: LCEL and its benefits
- **[Runnable interface](/docs/expression_language/interface)**: The standard interface for LCEL objects
- **[Primitives](/docs/expression_language/primitives)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes

## Additional resources

### [Components](/docs/modules/)

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and integrations for many different components, including:

#### [Model I/O](/docs/modules/model_io/)
Formatting and managing language model input and output

#### [Retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection/)
Interface with application-specific data

#### [Agents](/docs/modules/agents/)
Let models choose which tools to use given high-level directives

### [Integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/)
LangChain is part of a rich ecosystem of tools that integrate with our framework and build on top of it. Check out our growing list of [integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/).
