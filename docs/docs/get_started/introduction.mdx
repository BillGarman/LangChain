# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

For these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:

- **Open-source libraries**: Build your applications using LangChain's [modular building blocks](/docs/expression_language/) and [components](/docs/modules/). Integrate with hundreds of [third-party providers](/docs/integrations/platforms/).
- **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith/) so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn any chain into a REST API with [LangServe](/docs/langserve).

### Open-source libraries
- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.
  - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **`[🦜🕸️ LangGraph](/docs/langgraph)`**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

### Productionization:
- **[🦜🛠️ LangSmith](/docs/langsmith)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.

### Deployment:
- **[🦜🏓 LangServe](/docs/langserve)**: A library for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs.

## Get started

We recommend following our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.

[See here](/docs/get_started/installation) for instructions on how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.

:::note

These docs focus on the Python LangChain library. [Head here](https://js.langchain.com) for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.
