# MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

>[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/) is a document database managed in the cloud. It also enables Lucene and its vector search feature.

This notebook shows how to use the functionality related to the `MongoDB Atlas Vector Search` feature where you can store your embeddings in MongoDB documents and create a Lucene vector index to perform a KNN search.

It uses the [knnBeta Operator](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/knn-beta) available in MongoDB Atlas Search. This feature is in early access and available only for evaluation purposes, to validate functionality, and to gather feedback from a small closed group of early access users. It is not recommended for production deployments as we may introduce breaking changes.

To use MongoDB Atlas, you must have first deployed a cluster. Free clusters are available. 
Here is the MongoDB Atlas [quick start](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

```bash
pip install pymongo
```


```python
import os

MONGODB_ATLAS_URI = os.environ['MONGODB_ATLAS_URI']
```

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. Make sure the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set up before proceeding.

Now, let's create a Lucene vector index on your cluster. In the below example, `embedding` is the name of the field that contains the embedding vector. Please refer to the [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/define-field-mappings-for-vector-search) to get more details on how to define an Atlas Search index.
You can name the index `langchain_demo` and create the index on the namespace `lanchain_db.langchain_col`. Finally, write the following definition in the JSON editor:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "embedding": {
        "dimensions": 1536,
        "similarity": "cosine",
        "type": "knnVector"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
```


```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader('../../../state_of_the_union.txt')
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```


```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# initialize MongoDB python client
client = MongoClient(MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING)

db_name = "lanchain_db"
collection_name = "langchain_col"
collection = client[db_name][collection_name]
index_name = "langchain_demo"

# insert the documents in MongoDB Atlas with their embedding
docsearch = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    collection=collection,
    index_name=index_name
)

# perform a similarity search between the embedding of the query and the embeddings of the documents
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```
