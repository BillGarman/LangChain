    "# Message Memory in Agent backed by a database\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook goes over adding memory to an Agent where the memory uses an external message store. Before going through this notebook, please walkthrough the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Memory in LLMChain](/docs/modules/memory/adding_memory)\n",
    "- [Custom Agents](/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent)\n",
    "- [Memory in Agent](/docs/modules/memory/agent_with_memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to add a memory with an external message store to an agent we are going to do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are going to create a `RedisChatMessageHistory` to connect to an external database to store the messages in.\n",
    "2. We are going to create an `LLMChain` using that chat history as memory.\n",
    "3. We are going to use that `LLMChain` to create a custom Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a simple custom Agent that has access to a search tool and utilizes the `ConversationBufferMemory` class."
