# Custom LLM Agent

This notebook explains how to create your own custom LLM agent.

An LLM agent consists of three key components:

- `PromptTemplate`: This is the prompt template that instructs the language model on what to do.
- LLM: This is the language model that powers the agent.
- `stop` sequence: Instructs the LLM to stop generating as soon as this string is found.
- `OutputParser`: This determines how to parse the LLM output into an `AgentAction` or `AgentFinish` object.
