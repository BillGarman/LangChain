Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world.

## Getting Started

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with the world.
These tools can be generic utilities (e.g. search), other chains, or even other agents.

Currently, tools can be loaded using the following snippet:

import GetStarted from "@snippets/modules/agents/tools/get_started.mdx"

<GetStarted/>
