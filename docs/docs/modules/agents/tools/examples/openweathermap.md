# OpenWeatherMap API

This notebook goes over how to use the OpenWeatherMap component to fetch weather information.

First, you need to sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key:

1. Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for an API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/api/)
2. pip install pyowm

Then we will need to set some environment variables:
1. Save your API KEY into OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY env variable

## Use the wrapper

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->


```python
from langchain.utilities import OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper
import os

os.environ["OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"] = ""

weather = OpenWeatherMapAPIWrapper()
```


```python
weather_data = weather.run("London,GB")
print(weather_data)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    In London,GB, the current weather is as follows:
    Detailed status: broken clouds
    Wind speed: 2.57 m/s, direction: 240°
    Humidity: 55%
    Temperature: 
      - Current: 20.12°C
      - High: 21.75°C
      - Low: 18.68°C
      - Feels like: 19.62°C
    Rain: {}
    Heat index: None
    Cloud cover: 75%
```

## Use the tool


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"] = ""

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

tools = load_tools(["openweathermap-api"], llm)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```


```python
agent_chain.run("What's the weather like in London?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
