# CSV Agent

This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a csv. It is mostly optimized for question answering.

**NOTE: this agent calls the Pandas DataFrame agent under the hood, which in turn calls the Python agent, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.**

```python
from langchain.agents import create_csv_agent
```


```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
```


```python
agent = create_csv_agent(OpenAI(temperature=0), 'titanic.csv', verbose=True)
```


```python
agent.run("how many rows are there?")
```

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to count the number of rows
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df.shape[0]
    Observation: 891
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: There are 891 rows.
    
    > Finished chain.





    'There are 891 rows.'
```

```python
agent.run("how many people have more than 3 siblings")
```

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to count the number of people with more than 3 siblings
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df[df['SibSp'] > 3].shape[0]
    Observation: 30
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: 30 people have more than 3 siblings.
    
    > Finished chain.





    '30 people have more than 3 siblings.'
```

```python
agent.run("whats the square root of the average age?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to calculate the average age first
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: df['Age'].mean()

### Multi CSV Example

This next part shows how the agent can interact with multiple csv files passed in as a list.


```python
agent = create_csv_agent(OpenAI(temperature=0), ['titanic.csv', 'titanic_age_fillna.csv'], verbose=True)
agent.run("how many rows in the age column are different?")
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

```
    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to compare the age columns in both dataframes
    Action: python_repl_ast
    Action Input: len(df1[df1['Age'] != df2['Age']])
    Observation: 177
    Thought: I now know the final answer
    Final Answer: 177 rows in the age column are different.
    
    > Finished chain.





    '177 rows in the age column are different.'
```
