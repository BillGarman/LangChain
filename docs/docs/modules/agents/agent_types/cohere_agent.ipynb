In December 2022, Martin Kon, the former CFO of YouTube, became president and COO.In November 2021, Google Cloud announced that they would help power Cohere's platform using their robust infrastructure, and Cloud's TPUs would be used by Cohere for the development and deployment of their products.In June 2022, Cohere launched Cohere For AI, a nonprofit research lab and community dedicated to contributing open-source, fundamental machine learning research. It is led by Sara Hooker, a former research scientist at Google Brain.In December 2022, Cohere released a multilingual model for understanding text that would work with over 100 languages, to help users search for documents by meaning instead of with keywords. This type of process was not previously widely available in languages other than English.On June 13, 2023, Oracle announced a partnership with Cohere to provide generative AI services to help organizations automate end-to-end business processes.

On July 18, 2023, McKinsey announced a collaboration with Cohere, to help organizations integrate generative AI into their operations. In 2023, Cohere collaborated with software company LivePerson to offer customized large language models for businesses.On September 12, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had become one of 15 tech companies to agree to voluntary White House measures on testing, reporting, and research on the risks of AI.

Carriers supporting the initiative include Vodafone, Telstra, and Bell Canada.Cohere currently holds more than 300 patents relating to 4G, 5G, and OTFS.Co-founder Shlomo Rakib currently serves as Cohere\\'s CTO.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nAnnounced in 2021, Cohere\\'s  Universal Spectrum Multiplier (USM) software is designed to boost the performance of  4G and 5G FDD or TDD networks and can be integrated by network equipment suppliers in the radio access network (RAN) or as an xApp/RIC in the telco cloud. This technology has been tested by mobile operators such as Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, and Telstra.Cohere also announced the  Dynamic Network Alignment (DNA) tool  in 2023, which is an automated MU-MIMO beamforming solution for calibrating 4G and 5G networks using existing network and spectrum assets.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
