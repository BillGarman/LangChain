Models
==========================

LangChain provides interfaces and integrations for 3 types of models:

- `LLMs <./models/llms.html>`_: Models that take a text string as input and return a text string.
- `Chat models <./models/chat_models.html>`_: Models that are backed by a language model but take a list of Chat Messages as input and return a Chat Message.
- `Text embedding models <./models/text_embedding.html>`_: Models that take text as input and return a list of floats.

Head to the `Model quickstart guide <.models/getting_started.ipynb>`_ to get your first models up and running.
