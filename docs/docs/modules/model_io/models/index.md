# Models

LangChain provides interfaces and integrations for 3 types of models:

- [LLMs](./models/llms.html): Models that take a text string as input and return a text string.
- [Chat models](./models/chat_models.html): Models that are backed by a language model but take a list of Chat Messages as input and return a Chat Message.
- [Text embedding models](./models/text_embedding.html): Models that take text as input and return a list of floats.
