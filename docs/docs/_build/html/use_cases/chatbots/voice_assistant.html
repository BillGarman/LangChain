<p>This chain creates a clone of ChatGPT with a few modifications to make it a voice assistant.
It uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyttsx3</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">speech_recognition</span></code> libraries to convert text to speech and speech to text respectively. The prompt template is also changed to make it more suitable for voice assistant use.</p>

 Sure! Neural networks are a type of artificial intelligence that use a network of interconnected nodes to process data and make decisions. They are used in a variety of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. Neural networks are often used to solve complex problems that are too difficult for traditional algorithms.

 Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jack who lived in a small village. Jack was always honest and trustworthy, and his friends and family knew they could always count on him. One day, Jack was walking through the forest when he stumbled upon a magical tree. The tree told Jack that if he was honest and trustworthy, he would be rewarded with a special gift. Jack was so excited, and he promised to always be honest and trustworthy. Sure enough, the tree rewarded Jack with a beautiful golden apple. From that day forward, Jack was always honest and trustworthy, and he was rewarded with many more magical gifts. The moral of the story is that honesty and trust are the most important things in life.
