    "## Problem\n",
    "In any question answering application we need to search for, or retrieve, information based on a user question. In the simplest case, we can search on the user input directly. This approach has a few common failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data has multiple attributes that a user input could be referring to,\n",
    "* The user input contains multiple distinct questions in it,\n",
    "* Search quality is sensitive to phrasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these, we can do **query analysis** to translate the raw user question into a query or queries optimized for our index. \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: This guide assumes familiarity with the basic building blocks of a simple RAG application outlined in the [Quickstart](/docs/use_cases/question_answering/quickstart).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Query analysis is the process of transforming a user input into a query optimized for your index(es). This can involve any of the folowing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query decomposition**: If a user input contains multiple distinct questions, we can decompose the input into separate queries that will each be executed independently.\n",
    "* **Query expansion**: If an index is sensitive to query phrasing, we can multiple paraphrased versions of the user question to increase our chances of retrieving a relevant result.\n",
    "* **Query structuring**: If our documents have multiple searchable/filterable attributes, we can infer from any raw user question which specific attributes should be searched/filtered over. For example, when a user input specific something about video publication date, that should become a filter on the `publish_date` attribute of each document.\n",
    "* **Routing**: If we have multiple indexes and only a subset are useful for any given user input, we can route the input to only retrieve results from the relevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these steps are needed depends on the indexes we've created, which ultimately depends on the use case. The types of indexes we create and the query analysis steps we'll need might look very different when retrieving from a blog versus retrieving from a codebase. We'll cover all of the techniques at a high level in this guide, including when they're most useful and how you can optimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let's build a Q&A bot over the LangChain YouTube videos."

    "* **Query structuring**: If our documents have multiple searchable/filterable attributes, we can infer from any raw user question which specific attributes should be searched/filtered over. For example, when a user input specific something about video publication date, that should become a filter on the `publish_date` attribute of each document.\n",

    "\n",

There's a few possible ways we could combine these results:\n",

We might fetch 20 chunks and 20 titles, rerank the chunks based on their content + title relevance, and then include the top 10 reranked chunks in the prompt.\n",

      "In 2024, the LangGraph team has been actively working on enhancing the capabilities and applications of LangGraph, focusing on multi-agent workflows, collaboration, and hierarchical agent teams. Here are some key updates and developments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: The team introduced concepts for multi-agent collaboration, where multiple agents work on the same state of messages, sharing information and tasks to achieve complex goals. This approach allows for a more collaborative and efficient problem-solving process, where agents can leverage each other's strengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Agent Supervisor Model**: A new model called the \"Agent Supervisor\" was introduced, where a supervisor agent oversees the operation of multiple independent agents. Each agent works on its task and returns the final answer to the supervisor, which then decides the next course of action. This model allows for a clear separation of concerns and can enable more complex workflows by combining the outputs of various agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hierarchical Agent Teams**: The team explored hierarchical agent teams, where agents are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each agent or team of agents handling specific parts of a larger task. This structure allows for the decomposition of complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, which can be tackled by specialized agents or teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhanced Debugging and Observability with LangSmith**: Integration with LangSmith has been improved to provide better debugging and observability for multi-agent workflows created with LangGraph. This allows developers to track the execution of agents, understand the flow of information between agents, and debug issues more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Expanded Toolset for Agents**: The toolset available for agents to use within LangGraph workflows has been expanded, including new tools for data retrieval, processing, and analysis. This expansion enables agents to perform a wider range of tasks and handle more complex workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Improved Performance and Scalability**: Efforts have been made to improve the performance and scalability of LangGraph, ensuring that it can handle larger and more complex multi-agent workflows efficiently. This includes optimizations in the execution of agent workflows and enhancements in the underlying infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Community Contributions and Templates**: The LangGraph team has encouraged community contributions, leading to a richer set of templates and examples for building multi-agent workflows. These community-contributed resources provide valuable starting points and inspiration for developers creating their own workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Educational Resources and Documentation**: The team has released new educational resources, including tutorials, videos, and documentation, to help developers get started with LangGraph and build effective multi-agent workflows. These resources cover best practices, design patterns, and case studies to illustrate the capabilities of LangGraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "These updates reflect the LangGraph team's commitment to advancing the state of multi-agent systems and providing developers with powerful tools to build complex, collaborative workflows."
