    "One of the most common types of databases that we can build Q&A systems for are SQL databases. LangChain comes with a number of built-in chains and agents that are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite). They enable use cases such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions,\n",
    "* Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data,\n",
    "* Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze,\n",

    "and much more.\n",

    "## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high-level, the steps of any SQL chain and agent are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert question to SQL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.\n",
    "2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the SQL query.\n",
    "3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we drill into our examples we'll see that we can add optimization steps in between these, and agents are able to repeat the steps in a loop.\n",
