    "# Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of extraction results depends on many factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a set of guidelines to help you squeeze out the best performance from your models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improve the prompt to be precise and to the point.\n",
    "* Document the schema well\n",
    "* Improve the prompt itself to be more specific.\n",
    "* Add more examples. Diverse examples can help, including examples where nothing should be extracted.\n",
    "* Try a better model (e.g., gpt-4).\n",
    "* If the schema is very larger, try breaking it into multiple smaller schemas, run separate extractions and merge the results.\n",
    "* Add verification/correction steps (ask an LLM to correct or verify the results of the extraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create and benchmark data for your use case using [LangSmith ü¶úÔ∏èüõ†Ô∏è](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).\n",
    "* Is your LLM good enough? Use [langchain-benchmarks ü¶úüíØ ](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-benchmarks) to test out your LLM using existing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keep in mind! üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs are great, but are not required for all cases! If you‚Äôre extracting information from a single structured source (e.g., linkedin), using an LLM is not a good idea ‚Äì traditional web-scraping will be much cheaper and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **human in the loop** If you need **perfect quality**, you'll likely need to plan on having a human in the loop -- even the best LLMs will make mistakes when dealing with complex extraction tasks."
