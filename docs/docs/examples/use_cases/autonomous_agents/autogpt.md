# AutoGPT

Implementation of https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT but with LangChain primitives (LLMs, PromptTemplates, VectorStores, Embeddings, Tools)

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

## Set up tools

We'll set up an AutoGPT with a search tool, and write-file tool, and a read-file tool


```python
from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import Tool
from langchain.tools.file_management.write import WriteFileTool
from langchain.tools.file_management.read import ReadFileTool

search = SerpAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions"
    ),
    WriteFileTool(),
    ReadFileTool(),
]
```

## Set up memory

The memory here is used for the agents intermediate steps


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
```


```python
# Define your embedding model
embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# Initialize the vectorstore as empty
import faiss

embedding_size = 1536
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

## Setup model and AutoGPT

Initialize everything! We will use ChatOpenAI model


```python
from langchain.experimental import AutoGPT
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
agent = AutoGPT.from_llm_and_tools(
    ai_name="Tom",
    ai_role="Assistant",
    tools=tools,
    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),
    memory=vectorstore.as_retriever()
)
# Set verbose to be true
agent.chain.verbose = True
```

## Run an example

Here we will make it write a weather report for SF


```python
agent.run(["write a weather report for SF today"])
```

    Prompt after formatting:
    System: You are Tom, Assistant
    Your decisions must always be made independently 
                without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths 
                as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications. 
                If you have completed all your tasks, 
                make sure to use the "finish" command.
    
    GOALS:
    
    1. write a weather report for SF today
    
    
    Constraints:
    1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.
    2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.
    3. No user assistance
    4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"
    
    Commands:
    1. search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions, args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}
    2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}}
    3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}
    4. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"
    
    Resources:
    1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
    2. Long Term memory management.
    3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
    4. File output.
    
    Performance Evaluation:
    1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
    2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
    3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
    4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.
    
    You should only respond in JSON format as described below
