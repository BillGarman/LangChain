## Multi-modal outputs: Image & Text

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! Instead, edit the notebook w/the location & name as this file. -->

This notebook shows how non-text producing tools can be used to create multi-modal agents.

This example is limited to text and image outputs and uses UUIDs to transfer content across tools and agents. 

This example uses Steamship to generate and store generated images. Generated are auth protected by default.

```python
from steamship import Block, Steamship
import re
from IPython.display import Image
```


```python
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.tools import SteamshipImageGenerationTool
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
```

## Dall-E 


```python
tools = [
    SteamshipImageGenerationTool(model_name= "dall-e")

```python
mrkl = initialize_agent(tools,

                        agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, 
                        verbose=True)
```


```python
output = mrkl.run("How would you visualize a parot playing soccer?")

    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
     I need to generate an image of a parrot playing soccer.
    Action: GenerateImage
    Action Input: A parrot wearing a soccer uniform, kicking a soccer ball.
    Observation: E28BE7C7-D105-41E0-8A5B-2CE21424DFEC
    Thought: I now have the UUID of the generated image.
    Final Answer: The UUID of the generated image is E28BE7C7-D105-41E0-8A5B-2CE21424DFEC.
    
    > Finished chain.
