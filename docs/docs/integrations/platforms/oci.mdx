## LLMs

### OCI Data Science Model Deployment Endpoint

> [OCI Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/home.htm) is a
> fully managed and serverless platform for data science teams. Using the OCI Data Science
> platform you can build, train, and manage machine learning models, and then deploy them
> as an OCI Model Deployment Endpoint using the
> [OCI Data Science Model Deployment Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/model-dep-about.htm).

If you deployed LLM on with VLLM or TGI framework, you can use the
`OCIModelDeploymentVLLM` or `OCIModelDeploymentTGI` classes to interact with it.

To use, you should have the latest `oracle-ads` python SDK installed.

```bash
pip install -U oracle-ads
```

See [usage examples](/docs/integrations/llms/oci_model_deployment_endpoint).

```python
from langchain_community.llms import OCIModelDeploymentVLLM

from langchain_community.llms import OCIModelDeploymentTGI
```
