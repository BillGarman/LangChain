# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

The `LangChain` integrations related to the
[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/) platform

## LLMs

### OCI Data Science Model Deployment Endpoint

> [OCI Data Science](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/home.htm) is a
> fully managed and serverless platform for data science teams to build, train, and manage
> machine learning models in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

The model can be deployed on OCI Data Science and exposed as the OCI Model Deployment Endpoint.
If you deployed LLM on
[OCI Data Science Model Deployment Service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-science/using/model-dep-about.htm)
with VLLM or TGI framework, you can use the `OCIModelDeploymentVLLM` or `OCIModelDeploymentTGI`
classes to interact with it.

To use, you should have the latest `oracle-ads` python SDK installed.

```bash
pip install - U oracle-ads
```

See [usage examples](/docs/integrations/llms/oci_model_deployment_endpoint).

```python
from langchain_community.llms import OCIModelDeploymentVLLM

from langchain_community.llms import OCIModelDeploymentTGI
```
