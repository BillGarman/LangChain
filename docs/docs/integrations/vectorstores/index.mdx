# Vector stores

One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is
to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query 
time to embed the query and retrieve the **embedding vectors** 
that are the 'most similar' to the embedded query. 

A **vector store** stores embedded data and performs a vector search for you. 

See more in [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/).
