      "1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions can only be based on common utility.\n",
      "2. The purpose of political association is to protect the natural and imprescriptible rights of man, which include liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.\n",
      "3. Sovereignty resides essentially in the nation, and no individual or group can exercise authority that does not come from the nation.\n",
      "4. Freedom consists of being able to do anything that does not harm others. The exercise of natural rights is only limited by the law.\n",
      "5. The law can only prohibit actions that are harmful to society. Anything that is not prohibited by law cannot be prevented, and no one can be compelled to do what the law does not require.\n",
      "6. The law is the expression of the general will. All citizens have the right to participate personally or through their representatives in its formation. It must be the same for everyone, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens are equal in the eyes of the law and have equal access to public positions and employment based on their abilities and virtues.\n",
      "7. No one can be accused, arrested, or detained except in cases determined by law and according to the prescribed procedures. Those who solicit, expedite, execute, or enforce arbitrary orders must be punished. However, any citizen called or seized under the law must obey immediately, and resistance is considered a crime.\n",
      "8. The law should only establish punishments that are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one can be punished except in accordance with a law established and promulgated prior to the offense.\n",
      "9. Every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. If it is deemed necessary to arrest someone, any unnecessary harshness that is not required to secure their person must be severely punished by law.\n",
      "10. No one should be disturbed for their opinions, even religious ones, as long as their expression does not disturb the established public order.\n",
      "11. The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious rights of man. Therefore, every citizen has the right to speak, write, and print freely, with the responsibility for any abuse of this freedom determined by law.\n",
      "12. The guarantee of the rights of man and citizen requires a public force, which is established for the benefit of all and not for the particular advantage of those to whom it is entrusted.\n",
      "13. For the maintenance of public force and administrative expenses, a common contribution is necessary and should be equally distributed among all citizens according to their abilities.\n",
      "14. All citizens have the right to personally or through their representatives determine the necessity of public contribution, consent to it freely, follow its use, and determine its amount, basis, collection, and duration.\n",
      "15. Society has the right to hold any public agent accountable for their administration.\n",
