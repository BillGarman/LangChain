    "We can use this as a [retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers). It will show functionality specific to this integration. After going through, it may be useful to explore [relevant use-case pages](/docs/use_cases/question_answering) to learn how to use this vectorstore as part of a larger chain.\n",

And not without some precedent, either.\\n3) A Link to the Past\\nEarly on in development, the team wanted an easy way to test - and illustrate - the interactions that they saw as the foundation of Breath of the Wild’s gameplay. Many of the goals for Breath of the Wild, he said, were actually born out of Skyward Sword - specifically, expanding on that game’s stamina gauge and restricted climbing mechanic, as well as giving players the chance to explore between the different areas.\\n', metadata={'title': \"Breath of the Wild - 19 Fascinating Facts From The Game's Development\", 'source': 'https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-development-five-year-anniversary-fascinating-facts', 'score': 0.96856, 'images': None})]"
