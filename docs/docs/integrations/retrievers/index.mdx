# Retrievers

A **Retriever** is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. 

**Note:** It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to 
store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Vector stores can be used 
as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.

See more in [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/).
