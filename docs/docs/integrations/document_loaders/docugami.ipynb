    "This notebook covers how to load documents from `Docugami`. It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Install necessary python packages.\n",
    "2. Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` environment variable.\n",
    "3. Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api"

    "## Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)\n",
    "2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later.\n",
    "3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)\n",
    "4. Explore the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. \n",
    "6. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.\n",
    "7. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/) to do high accuracy Document QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.\n",
    "2. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.\n",
    "3. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.\n",
    "4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.\n"

Upon Tenant\\'s execution of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an unconditional, irrevocable and transferable standby Letter of Credit in the amount of $250,000.00 (the \"Letter of Credit\"), which Letter of Credit shall be issued by a United States commercial bank which is reasonably acceptable to Landlord with at least a AA- rating as published by Standard and Poor\\'s Corporation or at least a Aa3 rating as published by Moody\\'s and which has an office in Palm Beach County , Florida at which draws can be made under the Letter of Credit, naming Landlord (or its successor as Landlord) as beneficiary and in the form of EXHIBIT \"G\" to this Lease. Upon issuance of the Letter of Credit, a copy of it shall be attached to this Lease. Landlord reserves the right to periodically review the financial condition of the issuing bank for any Letter of Credit and any renewal or replacement Letter of Credit and if Landlord determines that the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above, Landlord may require a replacement Letter of Credit in form and substance and from a United States bank acceptable to Landlord which satisfies the criteria set forth above. Landlord may draw upon the Letter of Credit at any time Tenant is in default under this Lease without prior notice to Tenant. The Letter of Credit shall have a term of at least 12 months , and it shall by its terms be renewed automatically each year by the bank, unless the bank gives written notice to the beneficiary, at least 60 days before the expiration date of the then existing Letter of Credit, that the bank elects that it not be renewed. If Tenant fails to provide a replacement Letter of Credit because the issuing bank no longer satisfies the criteria set forth above or if the Letter of Credit is ever not renewed and has less than 30 days remaining in its term, Tenant shall be in default of the terms of this Lease and Landlord may draw on the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit shall be transferable and the proceeds assignable. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all transfer fees incurred. If the financial institution which issued the initial Letter of Credit is ever declared insolvent or closed by the FDIC or other applicable governmental authority or is closed for any other reason (other than periodic branch closures which occur in the normal course of business), then Tenant shall, within 30 days after notice from Landlord, provide a substitute Letter of Credit to Landlord from another financial institution acceptable to Landlord in its sole discretion and which otherwise complies with the terms of this section and Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord\\'s attorneys\\' fees and costs incurred. Tenant agrees and acknowledges that Tenant has no property interest whatsoever in the Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof and that, in the event Tenant becomes a debtor under any chapter of the Federal Bankruptcy Code , neither Tenant, any trustee, nor Tenant\\'s bankruptcy estate shall have any right to restrict or limit Landlord\\'s claim and/or rights to the Letter of Credit and/or the proceeds thereof by application of Section 502(b) (6) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code . Any cure periods for a default by Tenant under this Lease shall not be applicable to a default by Tenant of the terms of this section. The Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a security deposit under this Lease, but rather as a third-party guaranty by the issuing bank guaranteeing all of the Tenant\\'s obligations under this Lease. For purposes of this Lease, the term “ Reduction Date ” shall mean the third anniversary of the Commencement Date and each annual anniversary thereafter. Provided as of each Reduction Date (i) Tenant is not in default of this Lease beyond any applicable grace period, (ii) Tenant has been current in all of its monetary and other obligations under this Lease during the 12 month period preceding the Reduction Date within any applicable grace periods, (iii) Tenant’s financial condition is equal to or better than its financial condition on the Date of this Lease, and (iv) Landlord has not drawn on the Letter of Credit for a default by Tenant, then the required amount of the Letter of Credit (the “ Required Amount ”) may be reduced effective as of the 10th day following each Reduction Date by $50,000.00 , and Tenant may deliver to Landlord a new Letter of Credit stating the reduced Required Amount to replace the Letter of Credit then being held by Landlord.', metadata={'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/docset:Florida-section/docset:Florida/dg:chunk/dg:chunk[2]/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/docset:TheTerms/dg:chunk[7]/docset:LetterofCredit-section/docset:LetterofCredit/docset:TenantsExecution', 'id': 'y04uqde1nkps', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_FL.pdf', 'source': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_FL.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1 p', 'tag': 'chunk TenantsExecution', 'Lease Date': 'February  25th , 2022', 'Landlord': '444  LAKEVIEW, LLC', 'Tenant': 'Shorebucks LLC'}),\n",
