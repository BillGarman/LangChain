    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Install necessary python packages.\n",
    "2. Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` environment variable.\n",
    "3. Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api"

    "## Quick start\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)\n",
    "2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later.\n",
    "3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)\n",
    "4. Explore the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. \n",
    "6. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.\n",
    "7. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/) to do high accuracy Document QA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.\n",
    "2. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.\n",
    "3. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.\n",
    "4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **id and source:** ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami.\n",
    "2. **xpath:** XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML.\n",
    "3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller.\n",
    "4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control chunking behavior by setting the following properties on the `DocugamiLoader` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can set min and max chunk size, which the system tries to adhere to with minimal truncation. You can set `loader.min_text_length` and `loader.max_text_length` to control these.\n",
    "2. By default, only the text for chunks is returned. However, Docugami's XML knowledge graph has additional rich information including semantic tags for entities inside the chunk. Set `loader.include_xml_tags = True` if you want the additional xml metadata on the returned chunks.\n",
    "3. In addition, you can set `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels` if you want Docugami to return parent chunks in the chunks it returns. You can further set . This is useful e.g. with the [MultiVector Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) for [small-to-big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg) retrieval. See detailed example later in this notebook."

The retriever therefore ends up finding unrelated chunks from other documents not even related to the **DHA Group** landlord.
