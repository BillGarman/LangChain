# Document loaders

## What is the document loader

**Document loaders** load documents from different sources.

See more in [Docs](/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/).

## How to add a new document loader

Please, use the following steps to add a new document loader:
1. **Names**. Imagine this document loader loads documents from the `MySystem`. 
   In this case we use the name `my_system` for the document loader artifacts.
2. **Develop** the document loader. We recommend using the `langchain/document_loaders/twitter.yp` as a template.
   1. Create a new file as the `langchain/document_loaders/my_system.py`.
   2. Create a class `MySystemLoader` that inherits from `DocumentLoader`.
   3. Implement the `load` and `lazy_load` methods. See the `langchain/document_loaders/brave_search.py` as an example.
   4. If `load_and_split` is needed, implement it as well. It needed if the original text 
      has specifics that can be used to split it into smaller parts. If the text splitting 
      can be done with existing text splitters do not implement this method.
   5. Add **docstrings** to the class. Docstrings are used to generate API Reference documentation.
3. Create **documentation**:
   1. Create an **example notebook** as `docs/docs/integrations/document_loaders/my_system.ipynb`.
      It shows all details of the document loader usage. The quality of this notebook is very important.
   2. Create an **Integration Card** as `docs/docs/integrations/providers/my_system.mdx`. 
      Please, follow the [example](docs/integrations/providers/twitter.mdx) format.
   3. The **API Reference** documentation is generated automatically from the docstrings.
