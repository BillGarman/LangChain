# Agents and toolkits


**Agents** are the main building blocks of LangChain. 
In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.

**Toolkits** are collections of [**tools**](/docs/modules/agents/tools/) that are designed to be used together
for specific tasks and have convenience loading methods.
