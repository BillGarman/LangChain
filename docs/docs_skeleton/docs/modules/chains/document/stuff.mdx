# Stuff

The Stuff documents chain ("stuff" as in fill or insert) is the most straightforward of the document chains. It takes a list of documents, inserts them all into a prompt and passes that prompt to an LLM. It is well-suited for applications where documents are small and only a few are needed for most functionality.
