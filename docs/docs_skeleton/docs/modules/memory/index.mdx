# Memory


The main interface for generative AI applications is a conversational interface.
An important part of being able to have a conversation is the system you are talking to remembers things.
at the bare minimum it should remember previous messages in the conversation.
Idealistically, they could remember more complex things, like information about specific entities.

LangChain provides a lot of utilities for helping add a concept of "memory" into a system so it can remember things about you.
This utilities can be used by themselves or incorporated seamlessly into a chain.
The concept of memory in LangChain involves two components:

- Reading from memory: This happens AFTER initial user input but BEFORE entering a chain. This can be used to pull in relevant information that is passed to the prompt.
- Writing to memory: This happens AFTER the output of the chain but BEFORE returning to the user. This can be used store information.

See the diagram below for a visual representation of this.

All of the complexity lies within what exactly the state is and how read/write is done.
This largely involves two parts:

## List of chat messages
Underlying memory is this list of chat interactions.
Even if these may not all be used directly, they need to be stored in some form.
One of the key parts of the LangChain memory module therefore is a series of integrations for storing these chat messages,
from in memory lists to persistent databases.

## Data structures and algorithms top of chat messages
Keeping a list of these chat messages is fairly straight-forward algorithmically.
What is less straight-forward, and therefore more interesting, are datastructures and algorithms built on top of chat messages that serve as memory.
A concrete example of this would be a summary of the chat messages.
In this case, reading the memory would just involve reading a string, and writing to memory would involve updating that string based on the most recent chat messages.
Different applications can involve different types of memory - for example, you could easily want to combine a summary of the whole conversation with the most recent N messages.

## Resources

For a deeper dive on the above parts, see:
- [Chat Message Storage](/docs/modules/memory/chat_messages/): How to work with Chat Messages, and the various integrations offered
- [Memory Types](/docs/modules/memory/types/): The various data structures and algorithms that make up the memory types LangChain supports

## Get Started

We will now dive into how to use a memory class within LangChain.
This will cover the basics of interacting with an using an arbitrary memory class.
