# Memory

By default, `Chains` and `Agents` are stateless,
meaning that they treat each incoming query independently (as are the underlying LLMs and chat models).
In some applications (chatbots being a GREAT example) it is highly important
to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.
The **Memory** class does exactly that.

LangChain provides memory components in two forms.
First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages.
These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used.
Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.

For advanced usage, check out the [How-to](./how_to/buffer.html) section.

## Get started

Memory involves keeping a concept of state around throughout a user's interactions with an language model. A user's interactions with a language model are captured in the concept of ChatMessages, so this boils down to ingesting, capturing, transforming and extracting knowledge from a sequence of chat messages. There are many different ways to do this, each of which exists as its own memory type.

In general, for each type of memory there are two ways to understanding using memory. These are the standalone functions which extract information from a sequence of messages, and then there is the way you can use this type of memory in a chain.

Memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages). The returned information can either be a string or a list of messages.
