# Data connection

Many LLM applications require user-specific data that is not part of the model's training set. LangChain gives you the 
building blocks to load, transform, and query your data via:

- [Document loaders](./document_loaders): Load documents from many different sources
- [Document transformers](./document_transformers): Split documents, drop redundant documents, and more
- [Text embedding models](./text_embedding): Take unstructured text and turn it into a list of floating point numbers
- [Vector stores](./vectorstores): Store and search over embedded data
- [Retrievers](./retrievers): Query your data
