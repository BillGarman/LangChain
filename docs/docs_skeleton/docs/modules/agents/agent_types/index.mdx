# Agent types

## Action agents

Agents use an LLM to determine which actions to take and in what order.
An action can either be using a tool and observing its output, or returning a response to the user.
Here are the agents available in LangChain.

### [Zero-shot ReAct](./react.html)

This agent uses the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf) framework to determine which tool to use
based solely on the tool's description. Any number of tools can be provided.
This agent requires that a description is provided for each tool.

- **Note**: This is the most general purpose action agent.

### [ReAct document store](./react_docstore.html)

This agent uses the ReAct framework to interact with a docstore. Two tools must
be provided: a `Search` tool and a `Lookup` tool (they must be named exactly as so).
The `Search` tool should search for a document, while the `Lookup` tool should lookup
a term in the most recently found document.
This agent is equivalent to the
original [ReAct paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf), specifically the Wikipedia example.

### [Self ask with search](./self_ask_with_search.html)

This agent utilizes a single tool that should be named `Intermediate Answer`.
This tool should be able to lookup factual answers to questions. This agent
is equivalent to the original [self ask with search paper](https://ofir.io/self-ask.pdf),
where a Google search API was provided as the tool.

### [Conversational](./chat_conversation_agent.html)

This agent is designed to be used in conversational settings.
The prompt is designed to make the agent helpful and conversational.
It uses the ReAct framework to decide which tool to use, and uses memory to remember the previous conversation interactions.

## [Plan-and-execute agents](./plan_and_execute.html)
Plan and execute agents accomplish an objective by first planning what to do, then executing the sub tasks. This idea is largely inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and then the ["Plan-and-Solve" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091).
