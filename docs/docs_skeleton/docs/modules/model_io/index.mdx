# Model I/O

The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- [Prompts](./prompts): Templatize, dynamically select, and manage model inputs
- [Language models](./models): Make calls to language models through common interfaces
- [Output parsers](./output_parsers): Extract information from model outputs
