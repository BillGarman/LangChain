# Model I/O

The core element of any language model application is...the model. LangChain gives you the building blocks to interface with any language model.

- [Prompts](/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/): Templatize, dynamically select, and manage model inputs
- [Language models](/docs/modules/model_io/models/): Make calls to language models through common interfaces
- [Output parsers](/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/): Extract information from model outputs
