# Prompts

The new way of programming models is through prompts.
A **prompt** refers to the input to the model.
This input is often constructed from multiple components.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.

- [Prompt templates](./prompt_templates): Parametrize model inputs
- [Example selectors](./example_selectors): Dynamically select examples to include in prompts
