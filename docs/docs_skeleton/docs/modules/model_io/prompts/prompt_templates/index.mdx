# Prompt templates

Prompt templates are pre-defined recipes for generating prompts for language models
for specific tasks.

A template may include instructions, few shot examples, and specific questions for the language model.

LangChain tooling helps to create robust prompt templates for a variety of tasks
that can be re-used across different language models.
