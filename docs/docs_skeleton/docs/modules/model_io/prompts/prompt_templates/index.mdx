# Prompt templates

A prompt for a language model is a set of instructions or input provided by a user to
guide the model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant
and coherent language-based output, such as answering questions, completing sentences,
or engaging in a conversation.

Prompts are typically generated from templates that can be reused and adapted to
different use cases.

A template may include:

* instructions
* few-shot examples
* specific questions for the language model
