# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
- **Data-aware**: connect a language model to other sources of data
- **Agentic**: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:
1. **Components**: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Each component is easy to use whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not.
2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: a chain is a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher level tasks. LangChain comes with built-in chains that can be extended or used as-is.

Off-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started, but as you dive deep into a use case it's possible you'll want functionality that isn't built in.
In such cases it makes sense to start building your own custom systems. Components make customization of existing chains and creation of new chains easy.

## Get started

Head to our [Quickstart](/docs/get_started/quickstart.html) guide to familiarize yourself with the framework.

## Modules

LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules (from least to most complex):

- [Model I/O](/docs/modules/model_io.html): Interface with language models
- [Data connection](/docs/modules/data_io.html): Interface with application-specific data
- [Chains](/docs/modules/chains.html): Construct sequences of calls
- [Agents](/docs/modules/agents.html): Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
- [Memory](/docs/modules/memory.html): Persist application state between runs of a chain
- [Callbacks](/docs/modules/callbacks/getting_started.html): Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain

## Use cases

Walkthroughs and best-practices for common end-to-end use cases:

- [Chatbots](/docs/use_cases/chatbots.html): Have long-running conversations that maintain context
- [Chat with data](/docs/use_cases/question_answering.html): Ask questions about a set of source documents
- [Analyze structured data](/docs/use_cases/tabular.html): Analyze CSVs, SQL tables, etc.
- And [more](/docs/use_cases.html)...
