# LangChain Hub

The core `langchain` Python package contains the core chain and agent objects.
It also contains default prompts and configuration to work with them.

However, these default prompts are not perfect and do not cover all use cases.
It's become fairly common to start off with these default prompts but then pretty quickly customize them for more specific use cases.

In order to make these customized prompts (and, by extension chains/agents) more widely available, we've started
a LangChain Hub. The goal is to make it easy for people to share prompts/chains/agents they've found useful, and also explore other's.
