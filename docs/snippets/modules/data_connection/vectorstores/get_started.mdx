This walkthrough uses the `chroma` vector database, which runs on your local machine as a library.

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')
```

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

# Load the document, split it into chunks, embed each chunk and load it into the vector store.
raw_documents = TextLoader('/docs/extras/modules/state_of_the_union.txt').load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
documents = text_splitter.split_documents(raw_documents)
db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

### Similarity search

```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

<CodeOutputBlock lang="python">

    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

### Similarity search by vector

It is also possible to do a search for documents similar to a given embedding vector using `similarity_search_by_vector` which accepts an embedding vector as a parameter instead of a string.

```python
embedding_vector = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query(query)
docs = db.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding_vector)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

The query is the same, and so the result is also the same.
