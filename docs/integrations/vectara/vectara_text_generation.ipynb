They provide a way to store and access information that can be used to configure applications and scripts. With the new Deno CLI tasks extension, developers can now easily configure environment variables for their Deno CLI tasks.\\n\\nThe Deno CLI tasks extension provides a task definition that allows developers to create tasks that execute the Deno CLI from within the editor. The task definition has an interface that can be configured in a `tasks.json` within the workspace. This interface includes a `command` field, which is the `deno` command to run (e.g. `run`, `test`, `cache`, etc.), and an `args` field, which is an array of additional arguments to pass on the command line.\\n\\nThe Deno CLI tasks extension also provides a way to configure environment variables. This is done by adding an `env` field to the task definition. This field is an object that contains the environment variables that should be set for the task. For example, if you wanted to set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production`, you would add the following to the task definition:\\n\\n```ts\\nenv: {\\n  N'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are an important part of any programming language, and they can be used to store and access data in a variety of ways. In this blog post, we\\'ll be taking a look at environment variables specifically for the shell.\\n\\nShell variables are similar to environment variables, but they won\\'t be exported to spawned commands. They are defined with the following syntax:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nShell variables can be used to store and access data in a variety of ways. For example, you can use them to store values that you want to re-use, but don\\'t want to be available in any spawned processes.\\n\\nFor example, if you wanted to store a value and then use it in a command, you could do something like this:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR=hello && echo $VAR && deno eval \"console.log(\\'Deno: \\' + Deno.env.get(\\'VAR\\'))\"\\n```\\n\\nThis would output the following:\\n\\n```\\nhello\\nDeno: undefined\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the value stored in the shell variable is not available in the spawned process.\\n\\n'}, {'text': '\\n\\nWhen it comes to programming, environment variables are an essential part of the development process. Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs and scripts to customize their behavior. In the case of Deno, environment variables are used to control the behavior of the Deno runtime.\\n\\nThe Deno runtime uses environment variables to control authentication tokens, the location of the Deno cache, and the location of the Deno executable. The DENO_AUTH_TOKENS environment variable is used to store authentication tokens that are used to access remote resources. The DENO_CACHE environment variable is used to specify the location of the Deno cache, which is used to store compiled code and other resources. Finally, the DENO_EXE environment variable is used to specify the location of the Deno executable.\\n\\nIn addition to the environment variables mentioned above, Deno also supports custom environment variables. Custom environment variables can be used to customize the behavior of the Deno runtime. For example, custom environment variables can be used to specify the location of the Deno plugins directory, the location of the Deno configuration file, and the location of the Deno log file.\\n\\nThe Deno runtime also supports the oh-'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. Deno offers built-in support for environment variables with `Deno.env`, and you can also use a `.env` file to store and access environment variables. In this blog post, we\\'ll explore both of these options and how to use them in your Deno applications.\\n\\n## Built-in `Deno.env`\\n\\nThe Deno runtime offers built-in support for environment variables with [`Deno.env`](https://deno.land/api@v1.25.3?s=Deno.env). `Deno.env` has getter and setter methods. Here is example usage:\\n\\n```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\", \"firebasedomain.com\");\\n\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_'}]\n"
