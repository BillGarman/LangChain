They can be used to configure your application, store secrets, and more. But how do you set environment variables when using the Deno CLI?\\n\\nThe answer is simple: use the Deno CLI tasks extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension provides a task definition for allowing you to create tasks that execute the `deno` CLI from within the editor. It also provides a template for configuring environment variables in a `tasks.json` file within your workspace.\\n\\nThe `tasks.json` file contains a `DenoTaskDefinition` interface, which allows you to specify the `deno` command to run, any additional arguments, the current working directory, and any environment variables that should be set when executing. For example, if you wanted to run a `deno run mod.ts` command, your `tasks.json` file would look something like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\\n  \"tasks\": [\\n    {\\n      \"type\": \"deno\",\\n      \"command\": \"run\",\\n      \"'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are an important part of any programming language, and Deno is no exception. Environment variables are used to store information that can be used by programs, and they can be set in a variety of ways. In this blog post, we\\'ll take a look at how to set environment variables in Deno, as well as how to use shell variables and pipelines.\\n\\nWhen setting environment variables in Deno, the syntax is as follows:\\n\\n```sh\\nexport VAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nThis will set the environment variable with the given name and value. To use an environment variable in a task, you can use shell variable substitution, like so:\\n\\n```sh\\nexport VAR=hello && echo $VAR && deno eval \"console.log(\\'Deno: \\' + Deno.env.get(\\'VAR\\'))\"\\n```\\n\\nThis will output the following:\\n\\n```\\nhello\\nDeno: hello\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to specify environment variables before a command, you can list them like this:\\n\\n```\\nVAR=hello VAR2=bye deno run main.ts\\n```\\n\\nShell variables'}, {'text': '\\n\\nWhen it comes to developing applications, environment variables are an essential part of the process. Environment variables are used to store information that can be used to configure the behavior of an application. In the case of Deno, environment variables are used to store authorization tokens that can be used to access remote private code.\\n\\nDeno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime that is built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It is designed to be a modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript applications. Deno is an open source project and is available for free.\\n\\nThe environment variable `DENO_AUTH_TOKENS` is used to store authorization tokens that can be used to access remote private code. This environment variable is used to store a list of authorization tokens that can be used to allow Deno to access remote private code. This is an important security measure as it ensures that only authorized users can access the private code.\\n\\nIn order to use the `DENO_AUTH_TOKENS` environment variable, you must first set it up in your environment. This can be done by adding the environment variable to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file. Once the environment variable is set up,'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. Deno offers built-in support for environment variables with `Deno.env`, and you can also use a `.env` file to store and access environment variables. In this blog post, we\\'ll explore both of these options and how to use them in your Deno applications.\\n\\n## Built-in `Deno.env`\\n\\nThe Deno runtime offers built-in support for environment variables with [`Deno.env`](https://deno.land/api@v1.25.3?s=Deno.env). `Deno.env` has getter and setter methods. Here is example usage:\\n\\n```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN\", \"firebasedomain.com\");\\n\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_AUTH_'}]\n"
