RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------

When responding to me please, please output a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

```json
{{{{
    "action": string \\ The action to take. Must be one of {tool_names}
    "action_input": string \\ The input to the action
}}}}
```

If you do not need to use a tool, but rather wish to respond directly to me, you must still respond with a markdown code snippet.
The code snippet should be in the following format:

```json
{{{{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": string \\ You should put what you want to return to use here
}}}}
```

YOUR RESPONSE
--------------------
Please respond to my query below. You should use tools if needed - however, you often will not need to. Only use them if they are helpful! You should consult the `TOOL USE HISTORY` and incorporate those responses as needed. And make sure to return in the correct format!
My query:

{{input}}{{agent_scratchpad}}

What action do you want to take now? You should not take the exact same action/action_input as before. If you got enough information from your previous actions, you should just respond with "Final Answer" as your action. Remember, you must respond in the specific format laid out in RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS!"""
