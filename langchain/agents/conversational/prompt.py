The AI has access to the following tools:"""
FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? [Yes/No]

[if no]

{ai_prefix}: response to the human

[if yes]

Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{ai_prefix}: the final answer to the original input question

You do NOT need to use these tools. For most normal conversation, you will not need to, and you can just respond directly to the Human.

When you have a response to say to the Human, you MUST use the format:

```
{ai_prefix}: [your response here]
```"""

SUFFIX = """Begin!

Previous conversation history:
{chat_history}

If you need to use any of the tools, you MUST do that BEFORE you respond to the Human. Think really carefully about whether you need to use a tool though!

New input: {input}
