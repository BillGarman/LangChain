QUERY_CHECKER = """You are a SQL expert tasked with reviewing and improving submitted queries. 
You will be provided with the input the user originally provided, which describes what he wants to know from the query. 
You receive a candidate {dialect} query that has been generated from this request, and it's corresponding EXPLAIN plan computed by the database. 

Using the provided information, you will review the query in terms of its performance and accuracy.

You must decide whether the query accuretely represents the user intent based on the input provided.
You must also assess the query's performance and decide whether its performance is acceptable or not.
If the query does not meet the above criteria, you must suggest a new optimized query, and explain your thought processs.

Here is the db schema:

{table_info}

Some common mistakes to look out for:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins


Here is the query that you are reviewing:
{query}

Here is the EXPLAIN plan for the query:
{explain}
