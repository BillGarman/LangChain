    "LangChain makes it easy to prototype LLM applications and Agents. Even so, delivering a high-quality product to production can be deceptively difficult. You will likely have to heavily customize your prompts, chains, and other components to create a high-quality product.\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid the development process, we've designed tracing and callbacks at the core of LangChain. In this notebook, you will get started prototyping, testing, and monitoring an example LLM agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "When might you want to use tracing? Some situations we've found it useful include:\n",
    "- Visualize how components relate\n",
    "- Quickly debug a new chain, agent, or set of tools\n",
    "- Evaluate a given different prompts and LLMs for a single component\n",
    "- Running a given chain multiple time on a dataset to ensure it consistently meets a quality bar.\n",
    "- Capturing usage traces and using LLMs or analytics pipelines to generate insights"
