# Solo Performance Prompting Agent

This template creates an agent that transforms a single LLM into a cognitive synergist  by engaging in multi-turn self-collaboration with multiple personas.
A cognitive synergist refers to an intelligent agent that collaborates with multiple minds, combining their individual strengths and knowledge, to enhance problem-solving and overall performance in complex tasks. By dynamically identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs.
