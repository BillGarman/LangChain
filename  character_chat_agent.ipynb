His wisdom and understanding of the Force were unmatched, making him an important figure in the Jedi Order. After the fall of the Order, Yoda went into hiding, dedicating himself to a simple life on Dagobah, where he continued to ponder the mysteries of the Force and trained the last hope of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker.\n",

    "You are wise, patient, and humble. You possesses a keen sense of humor and often speak in riddles to challenge his students. Your dedication to the Light Side of the Force and the Jedi way is unwavering, but you are not without your own flaws, such as initial reluctance to train Luke due to his doubts.\n",

      "Summary: The third season of the American television series The Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as the title character, a bounty hunter traveling to Mandalore to redeem his past transgressions with his adopted son Grogu and being aided on their journey by fellow Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze. It is part of the Star Wars franchise, set after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983). The season is produced by Lucasfilm, Fairview Entertainment, and Golem Creations, with Jon Favreau serving as showrunner.\n",
      "Development on a third season of The Mandalorian began by late April 2020, and it was officialy confirmed that December. The season continues the Mandalorian and Grogu's storyline following the events of its spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett while also resolving several plot points established in the previous seasons; the season also promotes Katee Sackhoff as a series regular. Filming began by October 2021 and wrapped in late March 2022. Composer Joseph Shirley replaces Ludwig Göransson who composed the score for the previous seasons.\n",
      "The eight-episode season premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on March 1, 2023, and ran until April 19, 2023. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, musical score, direction, cinematography, and action sequences, but criticism for the writing and pacing, with some deeming the season weaker than its predecessors. A fourth season is in development.\n",

      "Summary: The Last of Us is an American post-apocalyptic drama television series created by Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann for HBO. Based on the 2013 video game developed by Naughty Dog, the series is set in 2023, twenty years into a pandemic caused by a mass fungal infection, which causes its hosts to transform into zombie-like creatures and collapses society. The series follows Joel (Pedro Pascal), a smuggler tasked with escorting the immune teenager Ellie (Bella Ramsey) across a post-apocalyptic United States.\n",
      "Guest stars include Nico Parker as Joel's daughter Sarah, Merle Dandridge as resistance leader Marlene, Anna Torv as Joel's partner Tess, Gabriel Luna as Joel's brother Tommy, Lamar Johnson and Keivonn Montreal Woodard as brothers Henry and Sam, and Melanie Lynskey and Jeffrey Pierce as resistance leader Kathleen and her second-in-command Perry.\n",
      "The Last of Us was filmed throughout Alberta from July 2021 to June 2022. It is the first HBO series based on a video game, and is a joint production by Sony Pictures Television, PlayStation Productions, Naughty Dog, the Mighty Mint, and Word Games. Druckmann, who wrote and co-directed the original game, assisted Mazin with scriptwriting for the nine episodes of the first season. The score was composed by Gustavo Santaolalla, who composed for the game, and David Fleming.\n",
      "The Last of Us premiered on January 15, 2023. It received acclaim from critics, who praised the performances, writing, production design, and score; several called it the best adaptation of a video game. Across linear channels and HBO Max, the series premiere was watched by 4.7 million viewers on the first day—the second-biggest for HBO since 2010—and almost 40 million within two months; by March, the first six episodes averaged over 30 million viewers. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.\n",

      "Page: The Mandalorian\n",
      "Summary: The Mandalorian is an American space Western television series created by Jon Favreau for the streaming service Disney+. It is the first live-action series in the Star Wars franchise, beginning five years after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), and stars Pedro Pascal as the title character, a lone bounty hunter who goes on the run to protect the Force-sensitive child Grogu. Starting in the third season, Katee Sackhoff also stars as Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze, following her appearance in the second season.\n",
      "Star Wars creator George Lucas had begun developing a live-action Star Wars television series by 2009, but this project was deemed too expensive to produce. He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in October 2012. Subsequently, work on a new Star Wars series began for Disney+. Favreau signed on in March 2018, serving as writer and showrunner. He executive produces alongside Dave Filoni, Kathleen Kennedy, and Colin Wilson. The series' title was announced in October 2018, with filming starting at Manhattan Beach Studios in California. Visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic developed the StageCraft technology for the series, using virtual sets and a 360-degree video wall to create the series' environments. This has since been adopted by other film and television productions.\n",
      "The first season of The Mandalorian premiered with the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019. A second season premiered on October 30, 2020, and a third season premiered on March 1, 2023. A fourth season is in development. Interconnected spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew expand on The Mandalorian's timeframe, with an untitled feature film directed by Filoni set to serve as a conclusion to the interconnected stories.\n",
      "The series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with strong praise to the performances (particularly Pascal's), visual effects, cinematography, direction, action sequences, emotional weight, musical score, and the chemistry of the two leads. The first season was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, and won seven Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\u001b[0m\n",
