All dependencies have been installed in the current shell. There is no
virtualenv or a need for `poetry` inside the container.

Running the command `make docker.run` at the root directory of the project will
build the container the first time. On the next runs it will use the cached
image. A rebuild will happen when changes are made to the source code.

You local source directory has been mounted to the /src directory.
