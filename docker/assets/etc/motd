The dependencies have been installed in the current shell.
There is no virtualenv or a need for `poetry` inside the
container.

Running the command `make docker.run` at the root directory
of the project will build the container the first time. On
the next runs, it will use the cached image or rebuild it if
a change is made on the source code.
